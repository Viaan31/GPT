One of the biggest challenges for any site owner is finding your readers, fans, customers, or subscribers. Until now, promoting your WordPress. com web site required multiple tools, online accounts, professional design and marketing skills, and – yes – lots of money. That’s why we’re excited to announce Blaze, a new tool allowing anyone with a WordPress blog to advertise on WordPress. com and Tumblr in just a few clicks. How? By turning your site content into clean, compelling ads that run across our millions-strong network of blogs. Create an ad today! How Blaze works If your website is hosted on WordPress. com, then head to wordpress. com/advertising and select your website — you’ll see a list of recent posts and pages you can promote. If your WordPress site isn’t hosted on WordPress. com, you can take advantage of Blaze through the Jetpack plugin. Alternatively, when viewing the post or page list in your WordPress. com dashboard, click the ellipses (three dots) next to any individual post/page to bring up a new menu, then click “Promote with Blaze.” Now you’ll be in the Blaze Campaign Wizard. Step 1: Design your ad. The wizard automatically formats your content into a beautiful ad, but you can adjust the image and text however you like. Step 2: Select your audience. Want to target the whole world? Only people in certain areas? Folks who are reading content about a specific category, like movies or sports? As you adjust these settings, you’ll see our estimate of how many people you’ll reach. Step 3: Select your dates and set your budget. Run your ad for up to 28 days. As you update your budget and dates, we’ll tell you how many more people you’ll reach. Step 4: Finish and pay. We may offer the lowest ad prices in the industry, but we also protect your content with a system backed by Verity and Grapeshot. So rest easy knowing that your ads will only show up where they’re supposed to — and nowhere you’d feel strange about. Once your ad is running, you can check how it’s doing in the “Campaigns” tab of the advertising page. Our campaigns are billed weekly based on how many times your ad is shown, so you’ll only ever pay for what you signed up for. As always, you can find even more details about this tool on our support page. This feature is currently only available to users with “English” set as their primary language, but we’re working hard on bringing it to other languages as well. Try Blaze today Let us know what you think about Blaze! We’re excited to launch this powerful new feature, and we’re eager to get feedback. If you have any questions about it, challenges while using it, or ideas to make it better, please share them with our team. We’ll make sure a real person reads through all of the feedback, and we’ll be working tirelessly to make sure that this tool is something valuable for you.

That’s where the new Jetpack mobile app comes in! We know inspiration doesn’t wait for you to be sitting at your desk. It can strike anywhere.

Inspiration, we’re ready for you! What’s more, the app brings the tools you need to manage and grow your site right to your fingertips: Understand how your content is performing and know what’s resonating with your audience using Stats and Insights.

Ready to take off? Get the new Jetpack app today! We’re constantly working on new ways to improve the Jetpack app and make it the best possible way to WordPress on the go.

Our newest features are largely design-focused, giving you the confidence to explore a variety of styles and then easily apply them across your entire site. Let’s jump in and see what’s new. Browse Mode: An easier way to navigate the Site Editor Browse Mode allows you to easily explore, navigate, and edit your site’s templates and template parts, including adding new templates right from this interface. To play around with Browse Mode, simply click your site’s icon from the Site Editor. When to use this feature: You want to see how all the pieces of your site fit together — and to jump between your templates and template parts for easy editing. Clearer access to your advanced block settings With more powerful blocks comes the need for easier, more intuitive access to advanced settings for those blocks. To that end, we’ve split block settings into two tabs within the sidebar. On the left side, you’ll find standard customization options like color, typography, and spacing. On the right side, you’ll find more advanced options, like layouts, custom CSS, and a button to apply changes across your entire site (more on that below). When to use this feature: You’re working on your navigation menu and need more customization than just color or typography options. Go over to advanced settings to change the orientation of the menu from horizontal to vertical — among other things! Preview style options with the Style Book A number of themes, including staff favorite Twenty Twenty Three, now come with styles, which change the look and feel of your site — color, spacing, etc. — within the overarching design aesthetic of the theme. With the newly launched Style Book, you can now see how various styles affect different blocks. You’re able to preview colors, typography, embeddable media, and more. When to use this feature: You’re curious about switching up the colors or typography on your site, but you want to know what it’ll look like, especially within specific blocks, before committing. Apply design changes across your entire site When working and designing in the Site Editor, it’s easy to find yourself having created a certain style that you really like and want emulated across your entire site. With our new “Apply globally” button, you can do just that. When to use this feature: You’ve spent some time styling a heading (or other block) on your homepage or a page template, and you want that look to carry over across all the headings (or whichever block you’re working with) on your site.

This year, leveraging the values of open source, Automattic shared the planning and organization of a company-wide 24-hour online event among the entire company, in order to create space for serendipitous connections. What followed was energy, diversity, and abundant creativity! The Purpose: Intentional Random Connections As we welcomed 2023, this event was an invitation to connect across divisions, timezones, and geographies across 90+ countries: Intentional: We scheduled a date one month in advance so that people could create space to join at times that were convenient to them and their team. Random: We invited any and all wonderful ideas to the agenda. We believe that great ideas can come from anywhere and anyone. Connections: Communication is the oxygen of a distributed company and our intention was to create space for connections to form. The Invitation: Open-Sourcing the Agenda Rather than deciding the agenda up front, we entrusted the agenda to the whole company. We invited people to contribute what they’d like and then join any sessions that interested them. (This structure is built on the values of Open Space by Harrison Owen.) Hosting a session was simple — all one had to do was choose a topic and add it directly to a shared Google Calendar which we created for the day. All that was left from there was to arrive on the day at their selected time to host their session with the folks who chose to join. Movement among sessions was welcome and everything was optional. The Outcomes: Abundant Creativity! In total we had 38 sessions hosted over 24 hours (both synchronous and asynchronous). The creativity, energy, and diversity that was created far exceeded what any one person could have planned on their own. We had cat parties, dog walks, asynchronous virtual raves, collaborative poem writing, role playing games, lego sessions, language lessons, art parties, parenting discussions, muffin making, company trivias, children’s book readings, open mics, musician parties, walks around the globe, and a lot of games! For the full list of sessions see the bottom of this post. While many companies report difficulty getting engagement in online company events, the survey feedback from this event showed that: 100% of participants would recommend future events like this 95% of participants met with someone they’d never met before 100% of people who hosted would host a session again For a 2,000-person company, these are pretty staggering results. The value of distributed ownership and co-creation speaks for itself! We hope these results convince you to try this out in your own organization!

We’re here to help you make an informed decision. What’s changing in the WordPress app? Until now, the WordPress app has included a range of Jetpack-powered features focused on managing, growing, and keeping tabs on your site. In early March 2023, we’ll be streamlining the WordPress app to focus on the writing and publishing basics. As part of that update, Jetpack features will be removed from the WordPress app and only be available in the Jetpack app. To continue using your favorite Jetpack features, switch to the Jetpack app today. Why are there two apps? WordPress comes in more than one flavor and is used for everything from newsletters to blogs, enterprise apps to high-traffic publishing networks. After listening to feedback from a diverse range of users and the wider WordPress community, it became clear that there are two main sets of expectations about what a mobile WordPress experience should look like. With that in mind, we set about rethinking and designing two distinct ways for you to use WordPress on the go: The Jetpack app is intuitive, free-to-use, and puts the full WordPress experience in your pocket, whether you’re new to publishing on the internet or a seasoned veteran. You get all the essential tools that come with the WordPress app, plus a suite of features for growing your site. Discover new content and communities with the Reader, track your site’s performance on Stats, and get notified about comments and reactions with Notifications. You can download the Jetpack app today. The updated WordPress app will focus on the basics of writing and publishing. If you’re only looking for the essential tools you need to publish on the go, with support for offline editing and the ability to upload media straight from your phone’s camera roll, this might be the best app for you. We’re excited to hear from you and will continue updating the apps to meet your needs. Please feel free to comment on this post with any questions or feedback. Which app should I use? Here’s how the two apps compare, feature by feature: FeaturesWordPress appJetpack appPostsxxPagesxxMediaxxCommentsxxSite SettingsxxStatsxReaderxNotificationsxActivity LogxJetpack SocialxJetpack BackupxJetpack ScanxMenusxPeoplexThemesx With the new Jetpack app, you’ll still be able to focus on publishing, but you’ll also have the added benefit of powerful site management and growth tools. The app is free to use. Once you make the switch, you’ll find all the same features that you enjoy with the WordPress app right there, at no extra cost. How do I make the switch to the Jetpack app? To make a seamless switch to the Jetpack app from the WordPress app, follow these steps: Make sure you have the latest version of the WordPress app installed. Download the Jetpack app for iOS or Android. Open the app, and you’ll be “auto-magically” logged in with all your data and settings in place, including locally stored content, saved posts, and other in-app preferences. After you’ve installed the Jetpack app, we’d advise you to delete the WordPress app. Managing your site across both apps is currently unsupported and may lead to issues such as data conflicts that are best avoided. We’re here to make the switch from the WordPress app to the Jetpack app as smooth as possible. Thanks for your continued support, and let us know if you have any questions. Ready to take off? Download the Jetpack mobile app today. Email Newsletter Missing out on the latest WordPress. com developments? Enter your email below to receive future announcements direct to your inbox.

We’re here to help you make an informed decision. What’s changing in the WordPress app? Until now, the WordPress app has included a range of Jetpack-powered features focused on managing, growing, and keeping tabs on your site. In early March 2023, we’ll be streamlining the WordPress app to focus on the writing and publishing basics. As part of that update, Jetpack features will be removed from the WordPress app and only be available in the Jetpack app. To continue using your favorite Jetpack features, switch to the Jetpack app today.","content_length":801,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Switch to the New Jetpack Mobile App","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/02/15/switch-to-the-new-jetpack-mobile-app/","post_date":"February 15, 2023","post_type":"post","content":"Why are there two apps? WordPress comes in more than one flavor and is used for everything from newsletters to blogs, enterprise apps to high-traffic publishing networks. After listening to feedback from a diverse range of users and the wider WordPress community, it became clear that there are two main sets of expectations about what a mobile WordPress experience should look like. With that in mind, we set about rethinking and designing two distinct ways for you to use WordPress on the go: The Jetpack app is intuitive, free-to-use, and puts the full WordPress experience in your pocket, whether you’re new to publishing on the internet or a seasoned veteran. You get all the essential tools that come with the WordPress app, plus a suite of features for growing your site. Discover new content and communities with the Reader, track your site’s performance on Stats, and get notified about comments and reactions with Notifications. You can download the Jetpack app today. The updated WordPress app will focus on the basics of writing and publishing. If you’re only looking for the essential tools you need to publish on the go, with support for offline editing and the ability to upload media straight from your phone’s camera roll, this might be the best app for you. We’re excited to hear from you and will continue updating the apps to meet your needs. Please feel free to comment on this post with any questions or feedback.","content_length":1434,"content_tokens":292,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Switch to the New Jetpack Mobile App","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/02/15/switch-to-the-new-jetpack-mobile-app/","post_date":"February 15, 2023","post_type":"post","content":"Which app should I use?

After you’ve installed the Jetpack app, we’d advise you to delete the WordPress app. Managing your site across both apps is currently unsupported and may lead to issues such as data conflicts that are best avoided.

Today we’d like to zoom in on the “Styles” settings, which allow you to make sitewide changes and create new style defaults right from the Site Editor. Professional design without a designer From basic options like colors and typography, to more advanced parameters like content dimensions, padding, and block-specific settings, you’re sure to find our style customizations useful no matter your level of design expertise (or lack thereof!). Though a number of themes come with style variations that you can test out, using custom Styles gives you even more freedom and flexibility to experiment and play around with various design pieces. Utilizing these settings creates new default styling for elements on your site, such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons. This means that any new pages or posts created will automatically inherit these styles, making the entire process much more efficient. Additionally, any changes you make will be reflected across the entire site, ensuring a consistent look and feel. Our Site Editor design tools are perfect for those who want to save time and effort while maintaining a consistent look and feel across their website. Learn more about Styles How to DIY design, with ease From the Site Editor (on the left sidebar, navigate to Appearance → Editor), click the “Edit” button at the top left of the page, and then the Styles icon on the top right. A sidebar will come up with a number of options to explore. (Note: This option may not appear if the theme you’re using isn’t compatible with the Site Editor.) The best place to start is with the Style Book. Using Style Book, you can explore the various color and typography schemes and get a sense for what different blocks will look like before implementing them: Once you’re out of the Style Book, you can click “Browse Styles,” which allows you to preview what those style elements look like on your actual site. Remember, nothing is set in stone until you hit the “Save” button. From there, you can experiment with specific settings for typography, colors, and layout. You can also fine-tune design aspects for specific blocks. For example, if you tweak the color or text size in the Heading Block, it’ll change every heading on your site as well as become the new default for any new headings. When you set a block-specific style from the Site Editor, any changes you make on specific pages or posts will only apply to that placement – though you can hit the “Apply globally” button to incorporate them across the entire site. Learn more about Styles Styles tools are available on Premium plans and above. Email Newsletter Missing out on the latest WordPress. com developments?

If a campaign or website calls for diverse and inclusive stock photography, you’ll more than likely come up short. That’s why WordPress. com is excited to announce the release of the Black x Tech stock photography collection! The Cocoamattic ERG, an employee resource group at Automattic, partnered with Nappy. co to release a collection of 90+ beautiful photos of Black people interacting with technology. Nappy, a company on a mission to increase the representation of Black and Brown people in openly licensed stock photography, was a natural fit to collaborate on the initiative. Nappy co-founder Jacques Bastien is a long time WordPress user, and shares the same passion for open source. Cocoamattic ERG co-lead Santana Inniss said of the collection, “Cocoamattic is a group that represents Black/African diaspora employees working at Automattic. Part of our mission is to increase representation of Black folks in tech. We know how impactful representation can be, and seeing yourself represented in media about technology can be the jumping off point for getting into a career in tech.” Seeing that representation of Black folks creating or engaging with technology was sorely lacking in stock photography, Cocoamattic wanted to tackle the problem head on. Santana continues, “Getting a beautiful, authentic collection of stock photos representing Black folks onto WordPress. com was so important to us. We selected Nappy for the synergy of mission, but also because photos on Nappy. co are now indexed through Openverse. org.” Openverse, an aggregator of openly licensed media, makes the Black x Tech photos accessible from your WordPress. com website via the Media Library, or the Image and Gallery blocks. Adding images via the Image Block Adding images from the Media Library If you’re looking to add diverse and inclusive photos to your WordPress. com site, that just got a whole lot easier with the Black x Tech photo collection, brought to you by Cocoamattic x Nappy.

We offer many options and tools that are available on all plans, at no additional cost. Whether you want to auto-share your website posts to a social media platform, display your social media posts on your website, provide links to your various accounts, or encourage your website visitors to share your content, we’ve got what you need to connect with your audience. Posting to Social Media All WordPress. com plans include Publicize, a feature that lets you automate posting to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Tumblr. When you set up and configure these social media accounts to your site, every new post you publish will automatically post to the platforms you’ve selected. This is a great way to repurpose your website content on your social channels, reach your audience where they already are, and drive traffic to your site. It’s important to note that Publicize cannot push posts to Instagram since Instagram doesn’t allow auto-posting from third-party services. However, if you’re on the Business plan or ecommerce plan, then you could consider using a third-party automation tool such as Buffer or Hootsuite, both of which can be connected to your WordPress. com site using plugins. There may be other tools that offer this feature as well, though you’ll want to research their limitations and plans to learn more.* *Please note that third-party tools and plugins are outside the scope of WordPress. com support. Social Media Feeds on Your Site Another option that WordPress. com offers is displaying your social media platforms on your website. You can add widgets, blocks, or feeds to your WordPress. com site to display posts from your social media accounts in real-time. This can help you stay connected with your audience when they’re taking a break from social media, but still checking your site. WordPress. com offers built-in features for displaying your social media feeds from Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and TikTok, to name a few. We also provide a number of support documents to help walk you through the options for these embedding features. Social Media Menus You can also strengthen the cross-connection between your website and your social media platforms with the addition of social media menus. Many WordPress. com themes offer a dedicated Social Menu that allows you to connect your site to various social media platforms and display their respective icons on your site. If your theme doesn’t offer this menu option, you can still create social media-style menus using our Social Icons Block. This ensures that your audience knows how to easily find you on your preferred social media platforms. Social Sharing Last but not least, don’t forget to enlist your visitors to share the love from your website to their social accounts by setting up WordPress. com’s Social Sharing option. This feature allows you to choose which social platforms you want to encourage your visitors to spread the word by providing a Share button on every piece of content you publish. Nothing connects your audience more than the ability to share. WordPress. com provides you with multiple built-in tools to make your website the centralized hub for connecting and integrating with your social media platforms—at no additional cost—so you can connect to your audience smoothly and seamlessly, all while driving traffic to your WordPress. com website. WordPress. com will be hosting a live special topic webinar on Tuesday, February 22, 2022 at 19:00 UTC. Join our WordPress experts to learn all of the essential tips to integrate social media with your website and how to add Link in Bio pages to your website. Register for free today!

In these interviews, we’ll be highlighting bloggers about their passion project. Caution: contents guaranteed to be inspiring. First up, The Travel Architect. A teacher from the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, The Travel Architect has been documenting her world-wide travels (usually alongside “the husband”) since 2018. It’s easy to get sucked down the rabbit hole of her writing; she’s always funny and entertaining, provides great tips, and is quite obviously a natural storyteller. Let’s learn more! 1. When did you realize that you loved to travel, and when did you start making it a priority in your life? It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact moment in time when I recognized travel as this thing I had to have in my life on a regular basis. Travel was a frequent part of my childhood and youth — cross-country road trips, ski vacations in the Rockies, Jamaica twice before first grade, a class trip to Spain, a month in Belgium as an exchange student, among other adventures — so my love almost certainly stems from those experiences. I’ve always been the kind of person who wants to know what’s just beyond the hill in front of me or what’s just around that bend in the river. While I’m not a danger junkie at all (my husband jokingly calls me “Head Safety”), I am attracted to adventure, whether that adventure is trying via ferrata or exploring a new culture. There were some lean travel years when I was in college, but after that I went on a two-and-a-half-month Colorado Outward Bound course that involved mountaineering, rock climbing, river rafting, and canyoneering. Shortly thereafter I moved to the mountains of Montana for a new adventure. Those were lean travel years, too, but living in the mountains in a new state felt a bit like travel. There I met my husband and eventually we relocated back to the Midwest, where I did all the mundane things like get a career and buy a house, but I always had to have travel on the horizon. That’s the funny thing — I’m actually quite a homebody. I love my home and being at home, but there’s a restlessness there that can only be relieved by travel. Thankfully, I’m married to someone who is a lot like me in that regard. Nearly indistinguishable from my love of travel is my love of travel planning. I know lots of people would sooner take a trans-Pacific flight in the baggage hold of an airliner than plan and book their own travels, but for me it’s pure bliss (except for international COVID travel, when it’s pure hell). 2. Obviously, COVID has totally disrupted “normal” travel. I’m sure some of your plans were set aside — what did you decide to do in place of some of those plans? Was there anything you learned about your passion in the midst of the pandemic? Yes, aside from a few colleagues at work who tell me they don’t like to travel (huh?!), I hardly know anyone who didn’t have plans ruined. I personally had a solo spring break trip to Sedona that went up in flames, and my husband and I had to cancel our trip to Spain, Andorra, and France. Instead, we enacted “Plan B.” We have a little 12-foot travel trailer that we took on a three-week Colorado-Utah-Colorado socially-distanced road trip. Once we were vaccinated we felt comfortable flying domestically, so we took a couple of trips out to different parts of California and one to Arizona. That Arizona trip was for my 50th birthday. I had long planned to do a much bigger trip to mark the occasion, possibly Japan, but that just wasn’t going to work with all the travel restrictions. As for lessons learned, I guess it would be about money. When you’re good about saving for travel as I am, and then you don’t have any travel to spend your money on, your travel account can start to get wonderfully plump. That was our state of affairs partway into the pandemic. When we finally started flying domestically to travel, we really splashed out on some nice accommodations in some beautiful spots. I learned that this form of travel, while lovely, can quickly deplete the account that once seemed bottomless. Now that we’re back to traveling a bit more regularly, I’m trying to rein in some of my luxury impulses. 3. Do you have a favorite locale that you find yourself recommending all the time? Maybe you could share one stateside and one international? Though I was born and raised in Wisconsin, I’m a mountain girl at heart. I will shout from the rooftops my love for Colorado — hands down my favorite state. I’m just transfixed by mountains. I’ve been to Colorado so many times I’ve lost count I and can’t seem to stop going back. Then there’s southern Utah, a close second, followed by the entire Four Corners region, and heck, the entire Mountain West all the way to the Pacific. This is why we haven’t seen much of the eastern seaboard and vast swaths of the southern US — the western United States just keeps calling to us. Internationally, for Americans who’ve never traveled abroad before, we often recommend England, which is where my husband is from. It’s a foreign country, but the lack of a language barrier makes it a great first-timer destination. However, our true favorite is France. We love the food, culture, and history. We love practicing our French with the locals. And no, we’ve never found French people rude or unkind. That’s a stereotype I get asked about often. Frankly, I’ve had people be outwardly rude to me only twice on my travels, and those incidents were in England and Italy. A Few of The Travel Architect’s Favorite Posts: A Travel Running Run-In Prepping for Travel: Learning Welsh Laos, Day 4+: Hiking, Remote Villages, and One Really Bad Indian Meal Thoughts on Air Travel 4. Any favorite travel tips that you can share with our readers? Whether about saving money, or the best apps, or some suitcase/backpack hack — we’re all ears! I’m more of a “travel stories” than a “travel tips” kind of blogger, but I do have one or two things I’ve learned from experiences that may help others. First, if you’re renting a car, as soon as you take possession of it, take a photo that includes the license plate, make, and model. Accommodations usually ask for this information when checking travelers in, and this way you don’t have to run out to the car. Second: always, always, always scrutinize your travel documents for accuracy. I failed to do this once and the airline nearly succeeded in denying me boarding on my flight to Jamaica. Another time I didn’t scan a hotel website as thoroughly as I should have and ended up booking a nonrefundable room. That was for the canceled trip to Spain and I’m still on the hook for it. (So far, they keep letting me kick the can down the road.) 5. When and why did you decide to start documenting your travels in a blog? What have you gained from blogging? For me, blogging is the perfect marriage of my two favorite things: writing and travel. For two decades my only writing outlet was my annual Christmas letter. Every year I got compliments on it and people suggested I start a blog, but I always thought, “What on earth would I write about?” My husband, too, often urged me to start blogging. One evening, fresh off an afternoon of travel planning and still experiencing some residual giddiness, our dinner conversation gave birth to the idea of a blog based around travel. I had long noticed that, despite being introverted, I could talk at length to anyone as long as travel was the topic. My husband had tried to start a blog once but it didn’t take, so the framework was there. We just transferred ownership of his blog to my name and the rest is history. In addition to honing my writing skills, I have gained friends (or what I like to call “blog buddies”) around the world. I’ve even met up with some of them — one in Laos, one in Thailand, and one here in Minnesota. 6. What are your travel plans this year? After a calamitous trip to England this past Christmas when Omicron was at its peak, we’ve sworn off international travel until the US removes its testing requirement to return home (I check weekly for news of its demise). Still, there’s plenty to see and do in this massive country, so we’re taking advantage of that. I have my long-awaited solo spring break trip to Sedona coming up, two years after it was originally scheduled. Then we’re spending a few weeks in June with our travel trailer in Colorado where we’ll be cycling, hiking a pair of 14ers, and soaking in lots of hot springs. My 85-year-old mom and I might head out to (yet another part of) California for a few days mid-summer, an idea that’s just come about and that will provide me with many hours of glorious travel planning. Finally, we just booked a week in Death Valley over Christmas. We’ve been there twice before, but always in summer when it’s 125 degrees with overnight lows in the 90s. It’ll be nice to have cooler temperatures so we can finally do some hiking and not have to force-feed ourselves a diet of Gatorade and ice cubes.

In these interviews, we’ll be highlighting bloggers about their passion project. Caution: contents guaranteed to be inspiring. First up, The Travel Architect. A teacher from the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, The Travel Architect has been documenting her world-wide travels (usually alongside “the husband”) since 2018. It’s easy to get sucked down the rabbit hole of her writing; she’s always funny and entertaining, provides great tips, and is quite obviously a natural storyteller. Let’s learn more! 1. When did you realize that you loved to travel, and when did you start making it a priority in your life? It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact moment in time when I recognized travel as this thing I had to have in my life on a regular basis.","content_length":806,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Travel was a frequent part of my childhood and youth — cross-country road trips, ski vacations in the Rockies, Jamaica twice before first grade, a class trip to Spain, a month in Belgium as an exchange student, among other adventures — so my love almost certainly stems from those experiences. I’ve always been the kind of person who wants to know what’s just beyond the hill in front of me or what’s just around that bend in the river. While I’m not a danger junkie at all (my husband jokingly calls me “Head Safety”), I am attracted to adventure, whether that adventure is trying via ferrata or exploring a new culture. There were some lean travel years when I was in college, but after that I went on a two-and-a-half-month Colorado Outward Bound course that involved mountaineering, rock climbing, river rafting, and canyoneering.","content_length":834,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Shortly thereafter I moved to the mountains of Montana for a new adventure. Those were lean travel years, too, but living in the mountains in a new state felt a bit like travel. There I met my husband and eventually we relocated back to the Midwest, where I did all the mundane things like get a career and buy a house, but I always had to have travel on the horizon. That’s the funny thing — I’m actually quite a homebody. I love my home and being at home, but there’s a restlessness there that can only be relieved by travel. Thankfully, I’m married to someone who is a lot like me in that regard. Nearly indistinguishable from my love of travel is my love of travel planning.","content_length":678,"content_tokens":155,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"I know lots of people would sooner take a trans-Pacific flight in the baggage hold of an airliner than plan and book their own travels, but for me it’s pure bliss (except for international COVID travel, when it’s pure hell) 2. Obviously, COVID has totally disrupted “normal” travel. I’m sure some of your plans were set aside — what did you decide to do in place of some of those plans? Was there anything you learned about your passion in the midst of the pandemic? Yes, aside from a few colleagues at work who tell me they don’t like to travel (huh?!), I hardly know anyone who didn’t have plans ruined. I personally had a solo spring break trip to Sedona that went up in flames, and my husband and I had to cancel our trip to Spain, Andorra, and France.","content_length":756,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Instead, we enacted “Plan B.” We have a little 12-foot travel trailer that we took on a three-week Colorado-Utah-Colorado socially-distanced road trip. Once we were vaccinated we felt comfortable flying domestically, so we took a couple of trips out to different parts of California and one to Arizona. That Arizona trip was for my 50th birthday. I had long planned to do a much bigger trip to mark the occasion, possibly Japan, but that just wasn’t going to work with all the travel restrictions. As for lessons learned, I guess it would be about money. When you’re good about saving for travel as I am, and then you don’t have any travel to spend your money on, your travel account can start to get wonderfully plump. That was our state of affairs partway into the pandemic.","content_length":776,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"When we finally started flying domestically to travel, we really splashed out on some nice accommodations in some beautiful spots. I learned that this form of travel, while lovely, can quickly deplete the account that once seemed bottomless. Now that we’re back to traveling a bit more regularly, I’m trying to rein in some of my luxury impulses. 3. Do you have a favorite locale that you find yourself recommending all the time? Maybe you could share one stateside and one international? Though I was born and raised in Wisconsin, I’m a mountain girl at heart. I will shout from the rooftops my love for Colorado — hands down my favorite state. I’m just transfixed by mountains. I’ve been to Colorado so many times I’ve lost count I and can’t seem to stop going back.","content_length":768,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Then there’s southern Utah, a close second, followed by the entire Four Corners region, and heck, the entire Mountain West all the way to the Pacific. This is why we haven’t seen much of the eastern seaboard and vast swaths of the southern US — the western United States just keeps calling to us. Internationally, for Americans who’ve never traveled abroad before, we often recommend England, which is where my husband is from. It’s a foreign country, but the lack of a language barrier makes it a great first-timer destination. However, our true favorite is France. We love the food, culture, and history. We love practicing our French with the locals. And no, we’ve never found French people rude or unkind. That’s a stereotype I get asked about often.","content_length":754,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Frankly, I’ve had people be outwardly rude to me only twice on my travels, and those incidents were in England and Italy.

Any favorite travel tips that you can share with our readers? Whether about saving money, or the best apps, or some suitcase/backpack hack — we’re all ears! I’m more of a “travel stories” than a “travel tips” kind of blogger, but I do have one or two things I’ve learned from experiences that may help others.

Second: always, always, always scrutinize your travel documents for accuracy. I failed to do this once and the airline nearly succeeded in denying me boarding on my flight to Jamaica. Another time I didn’t scan a hotel website as thoroughly as I should have and ended up booking a nonrefundable room. That was for the canceled trip to Spain and I’m still on the hook for it. (So far, they keep letting me kick the can down the road.) 5. When and why did you decide to start documenting your travels in a blog? What have you gained from blogging? For me, blogging is the perfect marriage of my two favorite things: writing and travel. For two decades my only writing outlet was my annual Christmas letter.","content_length":831,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Every year I got compliments on it and people suggested I start a blog, but I always thought, “What on earth would I write about?” My husband, too, often urged me to start blogging. One evening, fresh off an afternoon of travel planning and still experiencing some residual giddiness, our dinner conversation gave birth to the idea of a blog based around travel. I had long noticed that, despite being introverted, I could talk at length to anyone as long as travel was the topic. My husband had tried to start a blog once but it didn’t take, so the framework was there. We just transferred ownership of his blog to my name and the rest is history. In addition to honing my writing skills, I have gained friends (or what I like to call “blog buddies”) around the world. I’ve even met up with some of them — one in Laos, one in Thailand, and one here in Minnesota.","content_length":863,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"6. What are your travel plans this year? After a calamitous trip to England this past Christmas when Omicron was at its peak, we’ve sworn off international travel until the US removes its testing requirement to return home (I check weekly for news of its demise) Still, there’s plenty to see and do in this massive country, so we’re taking advantage of that. I have my long-awaited solo spring break trip to Sedona coming up, two years after it was originally scheduled. Then we’re spending a few weeks in June with our travel trailer in Colorado where we’ll be cycling, hiking a pair of 14ers, and soaking in lots of hot springs. My 85-year-old mom and I might head out to (yet another part of) California for a few days mid-summer, an idea that’s just come about and that will provide me with many hours of glorious travel planning.","content_length":834,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"WordPress.com Favorites: The Travel Architect","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/22/wordpress-com-favorites-the-travel-architect/","post_date":"February 22, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Finally, we just booked a week in Death Valley over Christmas. We’ve been there twice before, but always in summer when it’s 125 degrees with overnight lows in the 90s.

Live meetings have their place, and there are conversations that are better done in real-time, whether in person or through video chat. But they can be costly in terms of time and energy. At Automattic, we are often asked how we manage remote work and how we avoid excessive meetings, and internal email chains. We use P2, a product powered by WordPress. com, to collaborate with colleagues across time zones. My team, for example, lives everywhere from the Philippines to Romania — there is very little time for us to meet live. P2 is a platform for us to brainstorm ideas, share project updates, and communicate asynchronously. It’s a place where we all start our workdays, no matter where we are in the world, and catch up on what we’re all working on, what tasks need to be done, and what decisions need to be made. Think of it as an internal journal. A bulletin board. A virtual watercooler. For me, it’s kind of like reading the morning news. P2 can work for different kinds of teams or groups — people who work together within a distributed company, a virtual classroom or workshop cohort, an online business interacting with clients or partners, and more. Wondering how P2 can streamline your work, foster asynchronous collaboration, and eliminate unnecessary meetings? Here are 10 ways: 1. Offer courses that participants can take at their own pace We offer courses to help you make the most of your WordPress. com site. For this curriculum, we use P2 as a community hub where students read lessons, ask questions, get tips, and interact with other participants. This can be done asynchronously — students do not need to join Zoom calls at times that don’t fit their schedule, which makes it accessible for everyone, from wherever they are. 2. Automate requests across teams and departments You can use P2 to streamline processes in your organization, such as making requests. Need to send a contract to a new employee? Submit a request on your legal team’s P2. Looking for a designer to make a graphic for an upcoming blog announcement? Fill out a request on your design team’s P2. Hoping to parse stats on a recent campaign? Post a request on your data team’s P2. With these workflows in place, there’s no need to set up meetings to make these requests. Further discussions can happen in the post’s comments as needed. 3. Share status updates from across your company At Automattic, we have a P2 called Thursday Updates where every team is required to post a biweekly status update, which might include project highlights and high-level summaries. At many organizations, these types of updates are often delivered in PowerPoint or Google Slides at live meetings, often to full rooms with people who don’t need to be there. With P2, you can present information and updates with an array of blocks, including media embeds and project tracking tools. 4. Set up a space to introduce new colleagues The pandemic has changed the way we work, but traditionally, in many environments, new employees are often taken around and introduced to other staff. Automattic is a fully distributed company, and our teammates live around the world. One company tradition requires every new employee to write a welcome post on a designated P2, where they embed a short intro video about themselves. Other posts as part of the onboarding process include new employee interviews. These are all effective ways of getting to know people and to welcome them to your team — without needing to schedule a bunch of in-person meetings. 5. Create a private site to conduct trials with job candidates The process of hiring a new employee, from start to finish, can be time-consuming. The entire interview timeline can take weeks, sometimes months, often facilitated through an exhausting combination of phone calls, Slack chats, Zoom calls, and in-person meetings. All roles at WordPress. com and the rest of Automattic involve a trial: a period when candidates work with us on a short-term project, and when both sides can assess whether it’s a good fit. We create P2s for candidates on trial, and at this stage are able to learn a lot about them, particularly the way they think, communicate, and collaborate. And this is important: we believe a culture of strong written communication is essential for remote organizations. 6. Set up a virtual notepad for meetings and brainstorms Details of live meetings can be lost, especially when no one takes notes! At Automattic, we document external calls with clients and partners, sharing call notes in P2. And because P2s are searchable, employees — past, present, and future — can access important information discussed in meetings, even ones in which they were not present, to understand why decisions were made or to get the context they need to do their work. If you record video calls, you can also embed recordings on P2 with a number of video blocks, including Loom, Vimeo, and more, to supplement call notes. 7. Collaborate with partners and clients in a dedicated space If you run a business, you might find that partners and clients often want to schedule a recurring meeting, even if there are no major updates to discuss. P2 is a great platform to complement — and eliminate unnecessary — live meetings. You can create a P2 for your partner or client and brand it visually with custom colors and their company logo, and tweak the sidebar with relevant links and resources. On this dedicated P2, partners and clients can share written updates, ask quick questions, set up future calls, and correspond with your team throughout the week. You can then schedule meetings only when needed. 8. Celebrate wins, publish retrospectives, and more As you browse this list, you can see the power and versatility of P2. Powered by WordPress. com, P2 is, at its core, an internal journal — a space where your teammates, students, or group members can make announcements and share recaps. In some offices and work environments, people might schedule an after-work outing to commemorate a successful year, or plan an in-person retreat to discuss the long-term vision of a company. But these days, since it’s become harder to throw in-person events and to get together in person, we also use P2 to celebrate wins, post “state of the business” missives and share other essential longer-form content. 9. Share meetup guides and event summaries Teams at WordPress. com and across Automattic periodically meet up in person, giving teammates scattered across the globe a chance to see one another in real life. Planning a meetup can take up a lot of time, from researching locations and booking lodging to ensuring flight and other travel costs are within budget. Meetup planners must also wrangle or be aware of accessibility issues, visa procedures of all attendees, internet speed tests, and other logistics. P2 is a great way to compile details and publish post-trip recaps, and archive travel resources for teams who visit these locations in the future. Folks interested in a particular destination can refer to these guides while planning, which cuts down meetings to essential ones only. (Fun fact: historically Lisbon, Portugal, and Hawaii have been the most popular meetup locations at Automattic.) 10. Publish self-guided resources and internal documentation Teams across WordPress. com have access to a number of documentation P2s that we call Universities — such as Domain University and Scheduling University — that allow employees to self-train in new areas or brush up on skills. These P2s are quite comprehensive — learning this content might require a full-day live training session — but with these online “universities,” staff can work through resources and tutorials in their own time. P2 is free for everyone. Ready to get started? Create your own P2 today. Email Newsletter Missing out on the latest WordPress. com developments?

This can be done asynchronously — students do not need to join Zoom calls at times that don’t fit their schedule, which makes it accessible for everyone, from wherever they are. 2. Automate requests across teams and departments You can use P2 to streamline processes in your organization, such as making requests. Need to send a contract to a new employee? Submit a request on your legal team’s P2. Looking for a designer to make a graphic for an upcoming blog announcement? Fill out a request on your design team’s P2. Hoping to parse stats on a recent campaign? Post a request on your data team’s P2. With these workflows in place, there’s no need to set up meetings to make these requests.","content_length":834,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"10 Ways to Avoid Unnecessary Meetings with Asynchronous P2s","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/23/10-ways-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-with-asynchronous-p2s/","post_date":"February 23, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Further discussions can happen in the post’s comments as needed. 3. Share status updates from across your company At Automattic, we have a P2 called Thursday Updates where every team is required to post a biweekly status update, which might include project highlights and high-level summaries. At many organizations, these types of updates are often delivered in PowerPoint or Google Slides at live meetings, often to full rooms with people who don’t need to be there. With P2, you can present information and updates with an array of blocks, including media embeds and project tracking tools. 4. Set up a space to introduce new colleagues The pandemic has changed the way we work, but traditionally, in many environments, new employees are often taken around and introduced to other staff. Automattic is a fully distributed company, and our teammates live around the world.","content_length":874,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"10 Ways to Avoid Unnecessary Meetings with Asynchronous P2s","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/23/10-ways-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-with-asynchronous-p2s/","post_date":"February 23, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"One company tradition requires every new employee to write a welcome post on a designated P2, where they embed a short intro video about themselves. Other posts as part of the onboarding process include new employee interviews. These are all effective ways of getting to know people and to welcome them to your team — without needing to schedule a bunch of in-person meetings. 5. Create a private site to conduct trials with job candidates The process of hiring a new employee, from start to finish, can be time-consuming. The entire interview timeline can take weeks, sometimes months, often facilitated through an exhausting combination of phone calls, Slack chats, Zoom calls, and in-person meetings. All roles at WordPress. com and the rest of Automattic involve a trial: a period when candidates work with us on a short-term project, and when both sides can assess whether it’s a good fit.","content_length":894,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"10 Ways to Avoid Unnecessary Meetings with Asynchronous P2s","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/23/10-ways-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-with-asynchronous-p2s/","post_date":"February 23, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"We create P2s for candidates on trial, and at this stage are able to learn a lot about them, particularly the way they think, communicate, and collaborate. And this is important: we believe a culture of strong written communication is essential for remote organizations. 6. Set up a virtual notepad for meetings and brainstorms Details of live meetings can be lost, especially when no one takes notes! At Automattic, we document external calls with clients and partners, sharing call notes in P2. And because P2s are searchable, employees — past, present, and future — can access important information discussed in meetings, even ones in which they were not present, to understand why decisions were made or to get the context they need to do their work. If you record video calls, you can also embed recordings on P2 with a number of video blocks, including Loom, Vimeo, and more, to supplement call notes. 7.","content_length":910,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"10 Ways to Avoid Unnecessary Meetings with Asynchronous P2s","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/23/10-ways-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-with-asynchronous-p2s/","post_date":"February 23, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"Collaborate with partners and clients in a dedicated space If you run a business, you might find that partners and clients often want to schedule a recurring meeting, even if there are no major updates to discuss. P2 is a great platform to complement — and eliminate unnecessary — live meetings. You can create a P2 for your partner or client and brand it visually with custom colors and their company logo, and tweak the sidebar with relevant links and resources. On this dedicated P2, partners and clients can share written updates, ask quick questions, set up future calls, and correspond with your team throughout the week. You can then schedule meetings only when needed. 8. Celebrate wins, publish retrospectives, and more As you browse this list, you can see the power and versatility of P2. Powered by WordPress. com, P2 is, at its core, an internal journal — a space where your teammates, students, or group members can make announcements and share recaps.","content_length":965,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"10 Ways to Avoid Unnecessary Meetings with Asynchronous P2s","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/23/10-ways-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-with-asynchronous-p2s/","post_date":"February 23, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"In some offices and work environments, people might schedule an after-work outing to commemorate a successful year, or plan an in-person retreat to discuss the long-term vision of a company. But these days, since it’s become harder to throw in-person events and to get together in person, we also use P2 to celebrate wins, post “state of the business” missives and share other essential longer-form content. 9. Share meetup guides and event summaries Teams at WordPress. com and across Automattic periodically meet up in person, giving teammates scattered across the globe a chance to see one another in real life. Planning a meetup can take up a lot of time, from researching locations and booking lodging to ensuring flight and other travel costs are within budget. Meetup planners must also wrangle or be aware of accessibility issues, visa procedures of all attendees, internet speed tests, and other logistics.","content_length":915,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"10 Ways to Avoid Unnecessary Meetings with Asynchronous P2s","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/02/23/10-ways-to-avoid-unnecessary-meetings-with-asynchronous-p2s/","post_date":"February 23, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"P2 is a great way to compile details and publish post-trip recaps, and archive travel resources for teams who visit these locations in the future. Folks interested in a particular destination can refer to these guides while planning, which cuts down meetings to essential ones only. (Fun fact: historically Lisbon, Portugal, and Hawaii have been the most popular meetup locations at Automattic.) 10. Publish self-guided resources and internal documentation Teams across WordPress. com have access to a number of documentation P2s that we call Universities — such as Domain University and Scheduling University — that allow employees to self-train in new areas or brush up on skills. These P2s are quite comprehensive — learning this content might require a full-day live training session — but with these online “universities,” staff can work through resources and tutorials in their own time. P2 is free for everyone. Ready to get started? Create your own P2 today. Email Newsletter Missing out on the latest WordPress. com developments?

In these interviews, we’ll be highlighting bloggers about their passion project. Caution: contents guaranteed to be inspiring. This interview has been lightly edited. Shortly after Empish Thomas earned her journalism degree in the mid-’90s, she began experiencing severe headaches and sensitivity to light. After a visit to the eye doctor, she was diagnosed with uveitis, a generalized eye inflammation that can quickly escalate to permanent damage. Unfortunately, Empish fell into that category, losing her sight fully within a few years. Since then, she’s been a writer, journalist, and advocate for blindness and disability rights, telling stories and championing awareness along the way. Empish generously took the time to answer a few of my questions and share some ideas on how we can all be better advocates for disability rights. 1. Tell us a little bit about yourself. What do you write about and why? How long have you been blogging? I am a freelance writer and blogger. I started off as a writer many years ago and later started blogging in 2013. Although I have a journalism degree, I love writing for the pure pleasure of it. I launched my own blog about two years ago as a safe place to write my own thoughts and ideas about things that concerned me. I write especially about my life as a blind person because when I became disabled 20+ years ago, I rarely saw positive and interesting stories about the disabled. 2. What are some of the most common negative portrayals you see about folks with disabilities in the news or in pop culture? Well, there are actually two things I notice. One is the “superhero crip” image. That is a disabled person overcoming these incredible challenges and doing amazing things that everyone is impressed by. It sends a message that all disabled people are supposed to or want to be that way. It communicates a false expectation. At the end of the day, we are all human beings and live lives like everyone else. The second one is that we are not visible at all. Many times, I will read a story or watch a news segment and wonder, “Where are the blind people? What is happening to those with disabilities?” This is not necessarily a negative thing, but more [shows our] exclusion from the storyline. 3. Let’s move to the workplace. How can employers become better allies and advocates for disability rights? First, making sure that disabled employees get their accommodations to perform their jobs. Then, providing the support, encouragement, and motivation to help them move upward in the company the way you would an abled-bodied person. Sometimes I think that people with disabilities are not encouraged to move up into management or higher-level positions. It is like people can’t imagine a blind person as a supervisor or director. But with the right support, they could do the job like anyone else. A Few of Empish’s Favorite Posts: Working and Writing in the Disability Non-Profit World I’ve Become My Own Tech Support When Working From Home It’s a White Cane Not a Stick My Laundry Isn’t Smart But I Am My Blindness Protected Me From the Full Grief and Horror of September 11th 4. You’ve mentioned podcasts in a number of blog posts. Do you have any favorite listening experiences to recommend? Yes, some of my favorite podcasts are HISTORY This Week, LeVar Burton Reads, The Stacking Benjamins, Code Switch, and Grammar Girl. 5. What can someone do today to be a better advocate for disability rights, especially in the online space? For me, being a better advocate is learning as much as you can about blindness and visual impairment. Reading things written by disabled people in their own voices. Through my years of writing about the disabled, I have had people reach out to me to learn more and that is a good thing. Also, helping those of us with visual disabilities get access to the internet. I can’t begin to tell you the number of websites I go to with accessibility issues. It is a regular challenge. Reaching out to web developers is hard and exhausting sometimes. But having allies to help in this process would be wonderful. It could be a simple thing like bringing awareness, because people don’t think that blind people are online. 6. Do have any tips for aspiring bloggers or freelance writers? Depending on the type of blog you are writing, it is so important to be organized. I use an editorial calendar where I jot down blog ideas for each month. I think about things coming up, current events, trending topics, etc., and add them to the calendar. This helps me to keep a good flow of blog posts. Once people start subscribing they expect to see posts on a regular basis, and having an editorial calendar helps me stay on track.

Now we’re making all the benefits of WordPress available to more people, with one simple pricing plan. Hello, Pro One thing we heard over the years was how hard it can be to choose the right upgrade plan when you’re ready to scale up from Free. WordPress Pro radically simplifies that decision by rolling the very best of managed WordPress hosting into a single, affordable plan at just $15/month (paid annually). 50,000+ Plugins in Your Pocket Plugins are powerful add-ons that make it simple to add limitless functionality to your website in just a few clicks.

The feedback we received about the challenge was overwhelmingly positive, and it’s clear that prompts serve as a helpful way to inspire people to write and to connect with other bloggers. We want to keep that momentum going, so we’re excited to introduce a new set of prompts for creators of all types — whether they participated in Bloganuary or not. Meet WordPrompt, a single-word monthly exercise that aims to inspire you to create new posts, regardless of what or how you publish. Are you a food blogger sharing recipes? We challenge you to cook up something interesting based on an individual word. Are you a photographer with an online portfolio? Show us how the prompt is represented in picture form. Do you host a podcast or a vlog? We’d love to witness how a single word inspires an episode. Whatever you publish, we hope you find inspiration in WordPrompts. To join in on the fun, add “WordPrompt” as a tag to your post, allowing your content to be discovered more easily in the Reader, and use the hashtag #WordPrompt when you share your post on social media. You can find new WordPrompts on our social channels, so be sure to follow us to participate!

In these interviews, we’ll be highlighting bloggers about their passion project. Caution: contents guaranteed to be inspiring. Today’s featured blog, The Pelikan’s Perch, dives deeply into a niche of a niche: proprietor Joshua Danley writes solely about Pelikan-brand fountain pens. Even if you’ve never written with a fountain pen and know nothing about this graphological hobby, you’ll be captivated by Joshua’s interview below. 1. Tell us a little bit about yourself. What do you do for a living? What do you write about? How long have you been blogging? First and foremost, I am a father to two sweet and rambunctious little boys and a husband to an amazing wife. Most of the time, you can find me working at a community hospital in the Philadelphia suburbs. I am a pulmonary and critical care physician by trade, working in both in-patient and out-patient settings as well as serving as the medical director of my hospital’s ICU. As you can imagine, my days can be long and intense, never more so than since COVID-19 landed on our doorstep. It might surprise some, then, to learn that my blog has nothing to do with medicine or family. Instead, I write exclusively about the Pelikan brand of fountain pens, a brand that is nearly 184 years old. I launched my blog, The Pelikan’s Perch, on September 1, 2014, but I’ve been collecting fountain pens since 2012. While studying for my internal medicine boards, I would take breaks from studying by researching my small but growing collection of pens. It was a great way to decompress. I found a lot of great information, but it was fragmented and widely distributed across the varied corners of the internet. I spent a lot of time piecing it all together, really for nothing more than my own edification. At some point, it struck me that others might enjoy and benefit from the information that I was gathering for myself. That was the catalyst for the blog. I have no formal writing experience, though I always excelled in my English classes. I sought to combine a colloquial, conversational language that was easy to access while still applying a more rigorous scientific approach to the research behind each piece.2. Why Pelikan specifically? What makes the brand so special? Why not write about fountain pens more broadly? I received my first fountain pen in 2009 but have only been collecting them in earnest since 2012. I first collected a broad swath of brands and experienced many unique filling systems, dabbling in anything that caught my eye. It was a great education in the history and design of fountain pens. It wasn’t until 2013 that I acquired my first Pelikan, a lightly used white M205. It was love at first sight. The M205 was my first higher-end, piston-filled fountain pen and it stood out for its clean design and perfect balance when posted. It was enough to make me start seeking out other Pelikans. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t like I made a snap decision on the spot to dedicate myself solely to one brand, but as I began to gravitate more and more towards Pelikan, I started to forsake all of the others. My collection of Pelikans would grow with the addition of an old-style Black/Green M600 and then an M400 Tortoiseshell White. A medical resident’s salary isn’t much to speak about, so I started selling off my earlier non-Pelikan acquisitions to fund my new addiction, a decision that I have yet to regret all these years later. What makes the brand so special is that Pelikan pens have an indescribable quality, a character and a discipline, that makes owning and using them a joy that transcends the sum of their parts. There is a rich history and heritage behind the brand that really captivates the imagination when you start digging into it. I don’t write about fountain pens more broadly simply because there are a lot of amazing people already working in that space and putting out great content. I wanted my voice to be unique, so I sought out a niche within a niche. I think that laser focus has allowed me to bring high-quality content to the blog that might not otherwise be possible if I was more broadly focused. 3. You write within a niche of a niche. Do you ever feel constrained or like you might run out of ideas? Is it easy to come up with new content ideas? Time. Time is what I’m constrained by, specifically the woeful lack of it. My day job keeps me very busy, so my blogging is shoehorned into the odd hours of the night, at least when I’m able to stay awake. A lot of research goes into many of my pieces, and it is time-consuming to try and get things right. It’s not the subject matter that constrains, at least not yet. The Pelikan brand traces its roots back to 1838 and they have been making fountain pens since 1929. That’s 184 years of company heritage and 93 years of pen making, which means that there is plenty of fodder there to write about — if only my time and imagination were equally expansive. It has been a real blast being able to bring some of the more esoteric and buried information about the brand and its pens to the surface. I have a lot more ideas that I’m just waiting to be able to explore. 4. What are the benefits of writing with a fountain pen? What would you say to someone who’s never written with one in order to get them to try? First, I find the act of using a fountain pen somewhat cathartic. We are so connected and device-oriented these days. There is something special about unplugging and putting pen to paper. That tactile feedback, the nib gliding on a smooth line of ink, seeing your words come to life, that is something very rewarding. It can really unlock your creativity in a way our digital devices can’t. It also connects us to the past. While there are plenty of new, modern pens to be had, there are just as many vintage models out there. Picking one up can’t help but evoke images of who might have owned it and what might they have written with it. It’s a fun exercise of the imagination. The abstract aside, I think using a fountain pen helps improve retention and can be a stress reliever. Also, it can be very rewarding for those that like to write and send letters. When so much of our mail is junk, receiving a handwritten letter from someone is a rare treat and a special gift that anyone can give. That’s not a fountain pen–specific activity, but the exercise is more satisfying than when using a ballpoint. 5. There’s a robust community of fountain pen enthusiasts out there. What are some of your favorite resources, for folks who might be interested in exploring this vast world? When I was given my first fountain pen in 2009, I crashed and burned. I had no idea what I was doing, and I didn’t know where to look. That lesson in frustration turned me off to the concept and it took three years before I’d find my way back. The second go-round was much more successful, largely thanks to sites like The Fountain Pen Network and Fountain Pen Geeks which were very influential for me in my early days. I think they are still great repositories of information and there is a lot there for a novice to explore and unpack. Other sites are great too, such as r/fountainpens over on Reddit. Those are just some of the bigger forums and discussion boards. It would take way too much space to list all of the other great bloggers and other resources out there that also have great information. The forums make for a good starting point though. 6. Do you have any tips for aspiring bloggers, writers, and/or hobbyists? What has kept you going all these years? Find your own niche within a niche. Write about something you love, something close to the heart. That will keep you going. Keep at it but don’t sweat posting every day or every week. Do what you can, when you can. When it starts to feel like work and you begin to struggle, step away from it. It shouldn’t be a chore. For me, the blog has been a therapy of sorts. It’s a refuge where I can go to unplug from the stress of my day job and get lost in a world that has nothing to do with medicine. That stress reliever has been invaluable to my mental health.

I know, first-hand, how much work goes into getting a site launched. But the effort can’t stop there, because for most people, the whole point of publishing a website is to get people to see it. If your goal is like mine and you want to see a gradual increase in your site’s visitor traffic, a solid marketing strategy is needed. And no strategy would be complete without good SEO practices. SEO stands for search engine optimization, and as technology is always changing, optimizing your site for search engines, like Google, is a continual undertaking. This is why we launched our FREE course, Intro to Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The field of search engine optimization is complex and the sheer volume of information can be daunting and overwhelming for even the most fluent internet surfers.

With this new design update we worked on modernizing the out-the-box email templates that come with your WordPress. com website. Clean, Content-First Design Let’s take a look at the new look and feel. Design can have a huge impact on engagement. With the new update, your subscribers will get a fresh looking email when they subscribe, receive a welcome email, and whenever you publish new posts. The new designs put your content first, and look beautiful on any device. 1. Confirmation Email When a site visitor subscribes to your updates, the first email they’ll get will ask them to confirm their subscription. This helps make sure that the person subscribing is the owner of the email address shared. Just in case. To put your personal stamp on that email, you can edit the message that gets sent out. Just head to: Settings → Reading → Follower settings → “Blog follow email text”, and you’re all set. 2. Welcome Email Once your subscriber has confirmed that they’re good to go ahead, they’ll receive a Welcome Email. This one’s really important. It turns out that the average open rate of Welcome Emails is 82% (GetResponse, 2017). So, for every 100 emails you send out, 82 people will open them. Compare that with the average email open rate of just 21%, and it’s easy to see how making a good first impression really matters. 3. New Subscriber Email We don’t leave you out, either. At the same time your new subscriber gets their Welcome Email, you’ll get a New Subscriber email. So you can celebrate. 4. New Post Updates Now your subscriber’s all set, they’ll get a fresh new email every time you add a new post to your site. That’s one more reminder that you’re out there and publishing. And one more reason to keep coming back for more. Getting Started Email is one of the best ways to reach your site visitors, with 4.3 Billion users around the world forecast for this year alone (Statista, 2021). On WordPress. com, tapping into that huge audience is as simple as adding a block to your site. Check out our support guide for the subscribe block to walk you through how to get that up and running. Adding the block makes it a couple-of-clicks simple for your site visitors to subscribe to your content. And once they’ve subscribed, they’ll receive all of your latest updates – with the new, fresh design – direct to their inbox. Email Newsletter Missing out on the latest WordPress. com developments?

WordPress Starter is a new, beautifully pared-back plan designed to put that idea center stage. For just $5/month. Like the WordPress Pro plan (more on that below), WordPress Starter brings you the fastest WordPress managed hosting on the planet. Unlimited site traffic. And a revolutionary price. Make Your Mark From building your audience with a blog. To sharing your business, design, expertise, or experiences with the world. If you’re looking to make your work visible, and make it visual, the Starter plan has you covered. Let’s take a look at the details. Put Your Stamp on It – with a Custom Domain WordPress Starter unlocks custom domains – the ability to make your site’s address on the web your own. So instead of your web address looking like this: My-site. wordpress. com You can put your stamp on it, and make it look like this: My-site. com It’s the artist’s signature that separates a Picasso from a print. If you want to own a piece of the web, a custom domain name makes a powerful statement. And your first year of domain registration is on us. Make It Visual. Make It Visible. Photos and images can really set your site apart. Making it visual goes a long way to making it visible. Starter gives you a big boost in storage – a roomy 6GB for all your photos and images. So you’ll never need to think twice about adding visual flavor to every post. And every page. From Visible to Profitable – with Simple Payments As your site and audience grows, WordPress Starter has everything you need to start taking payments from your site visitors. Simple payments – included with Starter – bring you three ways to do exactly that: The Donations Form block gives you a simple way to accept tips and donations The Premium Content block opens up the option to sell one-off, monthly, or yearly premium content The Payment Button block gives you a fast way to take payments and set up subscriptions with Stripe Track Your Success – with Google Analytics Finally, Starter opens up an integration with Google Analytics. If you’re ready to dive a little deeper than the default WordPress. com stats, connecting your site to GA opens the door to a world of information. Who’s visiting your site, who’s coming back for more, and which content is really resonating with them is the tip of the iceberg. WordPress Starter vs. WordPress Pro So what’s the difference between WordPress Starter and the recently announced WordPress Pro plan? WordPress Starter WordPress Starter unlocks custom domains and the space to make your site beautifully visual and visible. It does that with a big boost in storage for your images – from 1GB on the free plan to 6GB on Starter. It also includes simple payments to get you started selling content, donations, and subscriptions. And with its Google Analytics integration, you’ll always be able to dig deep on what’s resonating with your audience, so you can double down on your success. And with Starter, you’ll never have to worry about site traffic. Because traffic is unlimited. Starter is a solid place to land if you want a great looking, blazing fast blog or website with simple payments baked in, but don’t want or need to dig deeper into design customization, interactivity, or integrations. Starter costs just $5/month. WordPress Pro WordPress Pro unlocks access to over 50,000 plugins and themes – an infinite, open library of ways to customize the features, interactivity, integration and design of your home on the web. Whatever your ambitions. Pair that with: Everything included with Starter 50GB of storage for images, audio, and videos A full range of ecommerce and payment tools with even lower commissions of 2% (plus processing fees), including the full power of WooCommerce out of the box Advanced SEO, design, and social media tools Beautiful premium themes Google Analytics integration Automated one-click backups SFTP and database access A free custom domain for your first year Unlimited user admins The ability to earn ad revenue from your site Premium expert support by email and live chat And a lot more than we could comfortably fit into this paragraph.

Pro is $15/month, billed annually. Spoiler: There’s Another Reason We Called It Starter We called the new plan WordPress Starter because it gives you an affordable way to get a beautiful site started and shipped. But that’s not the only reason. Coming soon, we’ll be introducing a range of add-ons that pair with Starter to give you an extra boost. It’s an a la carte way to add just what you need to Starter.

They can help make your site faster and easier to manage but also bring essential elements to your fingertips. From email opt-ins and contact forms, to SEO, site speed optimization, calendars, and booking options — the list is nearly endless. If you can imagine it, there’s a high likelihood that there’s a plugin to help you accomplish whatever your endeavor on your WP. com website. And because of the vast community of WordPress developers, there are always new plugins being added to our marketplace. To better help you select the plugins for your business or passion, we are listing three of our hand-picked, most popular premium plugins below, in addition to several others, recently added to our marketplace. WooCommerce Bookings This invaluable plugin allows customers to book appointments, make reservations, or rent equipment. Both you and your customers can save valuable time since there’s no need for phone calls, emails, or other forms of communication to handle bookings. Prospects simply fill out the information themselves. The benefits of WooCommerce Bookings are hard to overstate. For example, you can: Define set options, like fixed time slots for a class, appointment, or guided tourLet customers choose the times that work best by giving them the flexibility to book whatever range they need, like checking into a hotelSet certain time periods as off limits and un-bookable, providing yourself a buffer between bookings Perhaps best of all, the plugin integrates seamlessly with your Google calendar. Use the calendar view to see how your day or month is shaping up. Update existing bookings or availability, or filter to view specific services or resources. And if you have customers who insist on calling in to make bookings the old-fashioned way, you can add them manually from the calendar while you’re on the phone. Whether you’re running a small bed and breakfast, a fishing guide service, or anything in between, WooCommerce Bookings can give you back valuable time, ensuring your customers have a friction-free booking process, which allows you to focus your energies elsewhere. View the live demo here. Purchase WooCommerce Bookings WooCommerce Subscriptions With WooCommerce Subscriptions, customers can subscribe to your products or services and then pay for them at the frequency of their choosing — weekly, monthly, or even annually. This level of freedom can be a boon to the bottom line, as it easily sets your business up to enjoy the fruits of recurring revenue. Better yet, WooCommerce Subscriptions not only allows you to create and manage products with recurring payments, but you can also introduce a variety of subscriptions for physical or virtual products and services, too. For example, you can offer weekly service subscriptions, create product-of-the-month clubs, or even yearly software billing packages. Additional features include: Multiple billing schedules available to suit your store’s needsIntegrates with more than 25 payment gateways for automatic recurring paymentsAccessible through any WooCommerce payment gateway, allowing for manual renewal payments along with automatic email invoices and receiptsPrevents lost revenue by supporting automatic rebilling on failed subscription payments Additionally, this plugin offers built-in renewal notifications and automatic emails, which makes you and your customers aware of subscription payments being processed. Your customers can also manage their own subscriptions using the Subscriber’s View page. The page also allows subscribers to suspend or cancel a subscription, change the shipping address or payment method for future renewals, and upgrade or downgrade. WooCommerce Subscriptions really do put your customers first, giving them the control they want and will appreciate while allowing you to automate a process and experience that saves time and strengthens your relationship with customers.

Within locking you can choose to prevent them from being moved or to prevent them from being removed.","content_length":847,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"New Tools for More Successful Editing Adventures","post_url":"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/08/02/new-tools-for-more-successful-editing-adventures/","post_date":"August 2, 2022","post_type":"post","content":"You can also look forward to the ability to lock “inner blocks” which would make it easier to lock any number of blocks you have set up within a layout block like the group, row, or stack blocks.

In fact, did you know that Gutenberg releases new functionality and improvements every two weeks?! There have been a number of really cool and powerful capabilities rolled out over the last few months that give you even more control over the design of your site and your content. We wanted to take a minute to highlight some that we’re especially excited about. Note: These updates are most relevant to those of you who have a block theme activated. Use Your Featured Image in the Cover Block Borders in Layout BlocksSee What Margin vs Padding Actually DoesPatterns Are Easier to Find and More Convenient to UseLeveling Up the Query Block Notable Mentions Use Your Featured Image in the Cover Block Over the last few months the Gutenberg team has really powered up the cover block and its ability to leverage the featured image set in your post/page. Not only can you do that when creating new content, you can use it in your templates too, making it easier than ever to make your featured image a bigger part of every post. Borders in Layout Blocks You now have the ability to add and customize borders in the columns, row, stack, and group blocks. Use them for subtle dividers or go nuts to create some fun retro drop-shadows. This is a great way to make different sections on your site stand out! See What Margin vs Padding Actually Does I’ve been working in the web space for a long time and I still get confused with how padding and margin will impact my layout — especially when there are multiple layers of blocks involved!

Patterns Are Easier to Find and More Convenient to Use Gutenberg 12.7 brings patterns front and center to help save you time and energy. Why recreate a layout block by block when you can start with something more complete? Take advantage of all of the great patterns the WordPress. com designers put together for our customers or maybe consider adding a pattern of your own to the WordPress. org pattern directory. Leveling Up the Query Block The Query Loop has grown a lot over the past few months. Not only can you filter by different authors or taxonomies, but you can now filter to show all content under a parent category. This is perfect for creators who create different types of content or jump between drastically different subject matters. It’s really the ultimate block for displaying a collection of posts and it just keeps getting better. Notable Mentions You can now customize and display text on your social icons. We’ve made it easier to transform your content into different blocks without losing the work you’ve already done. Your new buttons will keep the design settings you already applied, preventing you from having to re-apply the settings for every button you add.

Sometimes, we change our content to optimize it for search engines. Other times, we find ways to reach new people, such as using tags so our blog posts show up in the Reader. Now, WordPress. com creators are getting access to an all-new tool to increase their audience. Originally released as Microsoft News, the revamped Microsoft Start is a global news and information feed that currently syndicates content from over 4,500 premium publishers to about a billion people! In an effort to expand and diversify this network, Microsoft has started an exclusive pilot program — and is looking for 500 highly qualified, independent creators in the U. S. to apply. Yes, this means you. Using the Microsoft Start plugin to connect your site to the platform, you’ll be able to build your brand and gain exposure by delivering your content throughout Microsoft Start’s ecosystem, which includes MSN, Bing, and Microsoft Edge. Additionally, you’ll be able to earn ad-sharing revenue via the platform, as well as 100% direct support through readers and your affinity links. Creators on the Microsoft Start platform act as their own syndicator and will maintain 100% ownership of their content. Even better, previously published posts can be repurposed as evergreen content using the built-in WordPress. com feed functionality. Do you qualify? Desired applicants are reputable topic specialists publishing content at least 5 times per month. Priority will be given to the following genres: food and drink; travel; health and wellness (which includes nutrition and fitness); relationships; parenting; demystifying science and tech; career and personal finance; the craft of writing; and DIY how-tos. Ideally, you also have an archive of at least 25 blog posts. If you’re interested in applying, Microsoft will sweeten the deal by paying 500 accepted candidates a $100 bonus upon publishing regularly for 60 days. (To qualify, candidates must submit their application by 11:59pm PDT on Sunday August 28, 2022 and enter “WordPress” as your referral.) Please note that there are terms and conditions all participating publishers must agree to in order to work directly with Microsoft Start. This opportunity is not an affiliate program between Microsoft Start and WordPress. com; it’s simply a special, limited-time opportunity we’ve helped to leverage for WordPress. com creators.

More Design Tools for Dozens of Blocks We’ve added a variety of design tools to dozens of blocks. Depending on the block, you’ll now see typography, color, border, spacing, and layout options. To play around with these new design tools, select the block you want to work with and use the right-hand sidebar to access these sections. You’ll see a few controls right away, but with just a couple clicks you can go even deeper. Select the three dots on the upper right of each section to find even more options, or hit the red chain link button to allow control over borders and/or padding for each side or corner individually. Without a doubt, one of the most fun additions is having more border options on Image Blocks: More Control Over Lists Our improved List Block means that lists are easier to manage from the toolbar. Every item and hierarchy in your list can now be manipulated as its own block. Rearranging, grouping, and nesting items has never been easier: Easier Block-Switching The block transforms menu offers a quick shortcut to switch to a different block, depending on your content. As the number of blocks has grown and you’ve started using this menu more and more, it’s been made more useful by changing the organization of what’s displayed at the top. For blocks that support paragraph, heading, list, and quote transformations — which are, by far, the most used changes — we’ve now emphasized those blocks: Keep building with the block editor. We’ll keep improving it. The block editor is always growing and improving as a result of your feedback, so thank you — we can’t wait to show you what we’re building next. In the meantime, we’ll continue working hard behind the scenes, with more updates to come! Have ideas for how to improve the editor? Let us know in the comments.

As a website owner, this is a way to allow your most ardent fans to show their gratitude for all the hard work you’ve put into your passion project over the years. As a reader, this is a way to show a bit of thanks to your favorite creators — be they bloggers, artists, small business owners, or even your pesky-but-loveable little brother who’s finally trying to give his site some attention. This feature will be displayed as a black banner across the top of the site, from which readers will be able to click “Gift” and then be taken right to a checkout page. Easy as that! As of today, we’ve rolled out this feature to a small number of sites, but that number will be growing every day as we continue to test and iterate. For now, gifting is available on sites that are within 54 days of their annual subscription expiration date or within 5 days of their monthly expiration date. Soon, however, it will be available much more widely. Update December 22, 2022: As of today the feature can be activated on any site, regardless of how far away it is from the subscription expiration date. How to activate the gifting banner You can activate this new feature in about 15 seconds: From your admin dashboard, navigate to General Settings (Settings → General) Scroll down, just a bit, to the “Accept a gift subscription” section Click the toggle to accept gifts Click “Save settings” After you’ve activated the banner, be sure to spread the word by writing a post about how your readers can help you out in a brand new way! A few more important details Gifting applies to whichever plan the website is currently on. For example: a subscription gift for a site on a 1-year plan will be for the entire amount of a 1-year plan renewal; a gift to a site on a monthly plan will be in the amount of 1 month on their current plan tier. (Note that gifts are made in the site owner’s currency.) Once a gift is paid for, both the website owner and the person who gave the gift will receive an email confirmation.

We’re excited to add a new feature to our hosting toolbox: you can now choose your primary data center when enabling hosting features on your WordPress. com Business site. While all sites on WordPress. com benefit from high-frequency CPUs, automatic data center failover, and worry-free burst scaling, selecting your primary data center gives you the ability to keep your content closer to your audience. Choose Your Primary Data Center By default, all WordPress. com sites are added to the optimal data center. If your audience is primarily in a specific region, you can maximize performance by picking the data center in that region. To select a primary data center, click on “Choose a data center instead” when visiting Settings > Hosting Configuration and activating hosting features. Once you do so, you’ll be able to select your preferred primary data center. WordPress. com has four primary data centers to choose from — with more on the way: US West, US Central, US East, EU West.

By selecting a primary data center, you can shorten the distance your content has to travel. Our Data Center Secret Sauce Many hosting providers resell existing solutions built for hosting a variety of web applications. We built our hosting for WordPress, and running our own data centers is the “secret sauce” that makes our sites so fast. The key ingredients to our secret sauce: High-Frequency CPUs. We use high-frequency CPUs to process WordPress and WooCommerce-specific queries at incredible speeds. Other hosts use lower performance CPUs and charge extra for better CPUs, if they’re even available. Automatic Data Center Failover. In addition to backups, every WordPress. com site is replicated in real-time to a second data center in a different region. Under the hood, we use ZFS to provide snapshots and also block-based replication. This unique, geo-redundant architecture helps ensure your site operates with maximum uptime. Worry-Free Burst Scaling. WordPress. com runs an in-house PHP build that integrates with our resource management tools and monitoring. It even allows for configurations to be changed dynamically on a per-request basis. Any WordPress. com site can instantly scale to over 100 PHP workers if the need arises. Custom data centers are just one of the many reasons why WordPress. com is the best managed WordPress hosting on the planet.

Use Site Preview Links to Share Your Work With Site Preview Links, you can generate a unique preview link for your in-progress Business or eCommerce site, allowing your team or clients to access the Coming Soon site without having to log in.

You can create and access the preview link directly from the Sites page: You can then share the link with your team or client. When they access the preview link, they’ll bypass the Coming Soon screen and be able to view your site. Site Preview Links is an easy-to-use feature that will save you time and hassle. It’s perfect for anyone who builds websites for others, whether you are an agency with a growing client roster, a contractor with just a handful of projects, or simply someone who knows a lot of people who need websites. How Site Preview Links Work WordPress. com uses a secure HMAC hashing algorithm to generate Preview Link that is unique across all sites. The possible number of unique hashes is 2256, which heavily exceeds the number of grains of sand in the world! Users who access your site using the shared preview link can continue navigating through the site, as WordPress. com uses a browser cookie to preserve the link value for the user’s session. The link won’t expire, but you can disable it anytime. Users who already have access to your site using the preview link won’t be able to access the site anymore once you disable the link. If you change your mind, you can always enable the link again, and we will generate a new, unique, ready-to-share URL. If you need help with Preview Links, check out our more detailed guide.
